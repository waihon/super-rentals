{{!-- This component's template doesn't render any content. --}}
{{!-- This component's only responsibility is to set up some piece of --}}
{{!-- state (this.results, the list of filtered rental properties), --}}
{{!-- and then yield that state back up to its caller (<Rentals>) --}}
{{!-- in the form of a block parameter (as |results|). --}}
{{!-- This is called the provider component pattern, which we see --}}
{{!-- in action with one component providing data up to its caller.--}}
{{!-- Ember allows us to pass arbitrary data to blocks in the form --}}
{{!-- of passing in additional arguments to the {{yield}} keyword --}}
{{yield this.results}}
